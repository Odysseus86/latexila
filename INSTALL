If you are installing LaTeXila from a .tar.bz2 or from a 'releases-*' branch,
you don't have to install Vala because the C code is already generated.
Otherwise, see the CMake configuration at the end of this file.


Simple install procedure
========================

$ cd build/			# go to the build directory
$ cmake ../			# run the Makefile generator
$ make				# build LaTeXila
[ Become root if necessary ]
$ make install			# install LaTeXila


Simple uninstall procedure
==========================

All the files installed are listed in the "install_manifest.txt" file.
So you can uninstall LaTeXila by doing this:

$ cd build/
[ Become root if necessary ]
$ xargs rm < install_manifest.txt


Configuration
=============

* Change the install directory (by default /usr/local/)
	run cmake with this option:
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/directory/

* Generate the C code from the Vala files
	run cmake with this option:
	-DBUILD_VALA=ON
