LaTeXila 2.2
============

- Structure (list of chapters, sections, etc. to easily navigate in a document):
	- Right click:
		- cut, copy, delete, select
		- comment
		- shift left
		- shift right:
			- display a warning if a subparagraph already exists

	  Shift left/right is new comparated to Kile. For example we have a big section (with
	  subsections, etc.) and we want to shift it to the left so it becomes a chapter (the
	  subsections becomes sections, etc.).

- Build Tools:
	- build tools: copy button to make a copy of a build tool,
	  so we can modify the copy and keep the original
	- right click menu in bottom panel: copy the line to the clipboard

- Cleanup Build Files: if a project is defined, some *.aux files are not removed
  => If a project is defined, instead of replacing the extension of the main
     file to see if the file exist and remove it, search directly all files
     which have the extension (in all sub-directories), and remove them.

- Write some documentation:
	- explain the build tools, how to create a new one, etc.
	- the difference between Latexmk and Rubber


LaTeXila â‰¥ 2.4
==============

- Check spelling

- Auto-completion:
	- show details by default
	- complete placeholders (\ref, \cite, ...)
	  (take into account all *.tex, *.bib, ... files of the project)

- Migrate to GTK+ 3.0
  I wanted to make the migration for the 2.2 release but GtkSourceView 3.0 have removed the
  gtk_source_completion_info_set_sizing() function.
  Also, GTK 3 widgets are a lot bigger, it doesn't fit well with LaTeXila.

(-) Structure:
	- Select the current section or item when the document cursor moves

	- Update on the fly the structure when the document is modified. An item can be inserted,
	  deleted or modified. The simplest way I think is to re-run the parsing only on the modified
	  lines (with a lower and upper bounds) every 2 seconds for example. This way, we simply
	  delete all items between the two bounds, and the parsing will re-add them correcly.

(-) Edit toolbar: create a custom MenuToolButton:
    Now the icon does nothing when we click on it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
    It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).
    A drawback is that the button would take more place, this can be a problem for small screens.
