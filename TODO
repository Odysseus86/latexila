LaTeXila 2.4
============

- Migrate to GTK+ 3.2, GtkSourceView 3, etc:
	- GtkBox -> GtkGrid
	- right click on document tab (the gray zone is ugly)
	- remove the border of toolbars
	- reduce some widgets sizes (some are too big)
	- use GtkApplication instead of Unique
	- test dev version of GtkSpell
	- replace gtk_source_completion_info_set_sizing()

LaTeXila â‰¥ 2.4
==============

- Completion:
	- show details by default
	- complete placeholders (\ref, \cite, ...)
	  (take into account all *.tex, *.bib, ... files of the project)
	- Insert an image easily. Instead of a wizzard, the approach is to have very good
	  completion of \begin{figure}[here], \includegraphics[here]{and here}, and automatically
	  complete the label with the filename of the image.

(-) Structure:
	- Select the current section or item when the document cursor moves

	- Update on the fly the structure when the document is modified. An item can be inserted,
	  deleted or modified. The simplest way I think is to re-run the parsing only on the modified
	  lines (with a lower and upper bounds) every 2 seconds for example. This way, we simply
	  delete all items between the two bounds, and the parsing will re-add them correctly.

(-) Edit toolbar: create a custom MenuToolButton:
    Now the icon does nothing when we click on it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
    It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).
    A drawback is that the button would take more place, this can be a problem for small screens.
