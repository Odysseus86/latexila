LaTeXila 2.2
============

- Documentation:
	- use gnome-doc-utils (autotools are required, so bye bye CMake :( )

- Build Tools:
	- BibTeX: problem writing .blg file
	- MakeIndex: problem writing .ind file
	- Some problems with the latex and latexmk post processors

- Structure:
	- When setting a model, expand all only if the tree is not too big

	- Insert in middle is very slow comparated to insert at the end
	  => Insert environments as soon as we find the \begin, and then update the item (or delete it)


LaTeXila â‰¥ 2.4
==============

- Auto-completion:
	- show details by default
	- complete placeholders (\ref, \cite, ...)
	  (take into account all *.tex, *.bib, ... files of the project)

- Migrate to GTK+ 3.0
  I wanted to make the migration for the 2.2 release but GtkSourceView 3.0 have removed the
  gtk_source_completion_info_set_sizing() function.
  Also, GTK 3 widgets are a lot bigger, it doesn't fit well with LaTeXila.

(-) Structure:
	- Select the current section or item when the document cursor moves

	- Update on the fly the structure when the document is modified. An item can be inserted,
	  deleted or modified. The simplest way I think is to re-run the parsing only on the modified
	  lines (with a lower and upper bounds) every 2 seconds for example. This way, we simply
	  delete all items between the two bounds, and the parsing will re-add them correcly.

(-) Edit toolbar: create a custom MenuToolButton:
    Now the icon does nothing when we click on it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
    It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).
    A drawback is that the button would take more place, this can be a problem for small screens.
