Guidelines for LaTeXila
=======================

LaTeXila source code is maintained using the Git version control system
and is available at the following location:

    git://github.com/swilmet/latexila.git

A Web Interface is available at:

    http://github.com/swilmet/latexila

You can download the source code from the Git repository by doing:

    $ git clone git://github.com/swilmet/latexila.git

Later, to take the new commits you just have to do:

    $ git pull


If you want to contribute to LaTeXila, contact the main developer (see the file AUTHORS).
Here is how you can generate a patch:

    $ git diff origin > patch

But creating a fork on GitHub and then make a pull request is simpler.

There are some rules to follow when coding:
    - indentation: 4 spaces
    - lines: 90 characters maximum (in some cases it can be a little more)
    - same coding style everywhere

How to generate the C code from Vala files?
    See the file "INSTALL".


Translations
============

How to generate latexila.pot?

    $ ./update_pot.sh

How to update the *.po files with latexila.pot file?

    $ cd build/ ; cmake ../
    $ make translations

How to create a new *.po for a new language?

    A lot of sentences are the same as in Gedit, so you can avoid
    re-translating them:
    	- download Gedit 2.30 sources:
	  http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/GNOME/sources/gedit/2.30/
	- take the Gedit *.po of your language and copy it in the po/ directory
	- update the *.po files with latexila.pot (see above)
	- at the end of the *.po file, you'll see a lot of lines commented
	  (i.e. beginning with #). That's all the sentences from Gedit that are
	  not present in LaTeXila. You can remove these lines.

    Anyway, if you want to create a completely new *.po, you can do:
    $ cd po/ ; msginit -l xx -o xx.po -i latexila.pot

How to translate LaTeXila?

    When someone begins translating LaTeXila, an announcement is made on the
    Mailing List. So to avoid duplicated work, make sure nobody else is already
    translating LaTeXila in your language. If it's not the case, then you can
    make the announcement. You can find the link to the Mailing List there:

        http://latexila.sourceforge.net/#contact
    
    The first thing to do is to take the *.po file from Gedit (see above). When
    it's done, you can use Poedit for example to complete the translation. Here
    are some strange items to translate:
        - translator-credits: Your name <your@email> (so your name will appear
          in the about dialog)

        Templates:
        - article-en.tex: article-xx.tex ("en" stands for English)
        - beamer-en.tex: beamer-xx.tex
        - book-en.tex: book-xx.tex
        - letter-en.tex: letter-xx.tex
        - report-en.tex: report-xx.tex

        Build Tools:
        - build_tools-en.xml: build_tools-xx.xml

        You will see a lot of items with an underscore. It's used for
        shortcuts (Alt + Letter underlined). If possible it is better to avoid
        having several times the same letter in the same menu.

    There is also the templates to translate in data/templates/ and the build
    tools in data/build_tools/. For the templates, add support for your
    language (in most cases add the babel package).

    Finally, there are two little sentences in data/latexila.desktop.

    Thanks!
